# About

This is a small game I made for a school project with the Phaser 3 JavaScript game framework.

# Tools used

- TexturePacker 6.0.2 trial version : for creating a texture atlas
- Phaser 3.55.1 : a framework for creating games
- Manjaro 22.0.0 : The operating system used while developing and testing.
- Apache/2.4.54 (Unix) : HTTP-server with which the software was served

# Influences

An example project created by Yannick (link below) had an influence on the project structure and
certain parts of the code. 

The project in question: https://github.com/yandeu/phaser3-typescript-
platformer-example.
